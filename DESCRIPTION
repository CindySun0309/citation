Description: 
      The purpose of this package, citation, is to make it easier for users to properly use/obtain an APA citation(s). 
      This package requires users to have a Google API code and the article title that they would like to have cited.
      Once the user provides this information, the package then runs necessary functions/operational commands to create an APA citation (APA_citation), which is returned to the user. 
      In addition to these features, this package also comes with a metadata set, citation_data.
